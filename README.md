<h2> Who am I? </h2>
<p> My name is Maria ( or Mary )! 😄 </br>
I'm currently a University Student, getting my bachelor degree in Mathematical Modeling and Data Science soon (hopefully)!  💪🎓</p>
</br>
<h2> My goals </h2>
<p> As for now I mostly focus on improving myself and my knowledge! And getting my diploma!🎓</br>
In the future, I'd like to work in a tech company as data scientist (or programmer)! 💻👩‍💻</br>

<h2> What am I working on now? </h2>
<p> I'm mostly working with Python and R right now. </br>
I'm studying about machine learning as well and trying to make use of it in my futrure projects. </br>
In my free time I'm trying to improve my knowledge and skills in data science and programming languages I've been learning before.</br>
</br>
Not connected with data science or programming, I started also two foreign language courses: German and Korean.  </p>
