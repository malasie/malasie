<h2> What am I working on now? </h2>
<p> I'm mostly working with Python but I'm trying out many other languages and tools as well. </br>
I'm studying about machine learning as well and trying to make use of it in my futrure projects. </br>
In my free time I'm trying to improve my knowledge and skills in data science, ML and programming languages in general. </p> 
 </br>
 
<h2> My intrests </h2>
<p> My free time I usually spend listening to music. I like to draw and trying diffrent creative things as well. </br>
I believe that being open to learning and trying new hobbies help as improve as a person. All gained knowleage and skills can be found usefull. </br>
That's why I love trying out new things a lot. </br>
I love learning new languages (lately I've been learning mostly programming ones though :joy:). </br>
One thing I'm curious about lately is game development and would like to see and learn the process of creating computer games. </p>
